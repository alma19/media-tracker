# Media Tracker API

The Media Tracker API was created as a way for you to keep track of media that you're interested in. With this API, you are able to create a database of books, movies, and TV shows that you are interested in, are currently reading or watching, or have already read or watched.

This API was built using the Laravel framework. It implements REST principles, which allows you to create, read, update, and delete items in your database via AJAX. The four HTTP methods used are: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
